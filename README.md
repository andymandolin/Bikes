A quick demo project using MapKit and REST API; more info at https://www.mandolindevelopment.com/#checkbike

This cyclist-focused app features a few unique tools. Check if your bike (or a bike you're considering purchasing) is stolen with just a serial number, or help your neighbor by being aware of stolen bikes in the area. You can quickly view bicycles that have been reported missing your your area, and see details the owner had submitted. You can also find local bike stores to find assistance. Be a better bicycle owner with CheckBike today!
